This repository contains documentation on the Orchestrator component of POETS.

Changes to the documentation should go through a review process (to be
determined). For now, talk to MLV.

The documentation is in plain text, specifically pandoc markdown. The supported
builder is pandoc (https://pandoc.org), but you should be able to use pretty
much any builder you like. A list of dependencies is maintained in the
Makefile.
