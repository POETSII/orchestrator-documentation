This repository contains documentation on the Orchestrator component of POETS.

Build status: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/POETSII/orchestrator-documentation.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/POETSII/orchestrator-documentation)

The documentation is in plain text, specifically pandoc markdown. The supported
builder is pandoc (https://pandoc.org), but you should be able to use pretty
much any builder you like.

If you wish to edit this documentation, branch off development, and raise a
pull request (https://github.com/POETSII/orchestrator-documentation/compare) so
that your changes can be discussed. Please do not commit directly into the
master branch.

Changes to the documentation should go through a review process, to be
determined. For now, talk to MLV.
